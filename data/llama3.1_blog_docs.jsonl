To enable training runs at this scale and achieve the results we have in a reasonable amount of time, we significantly optimized our full training stack and pushed our model training to over 16 thousand H100 GPUs, making the 405B the first Llama model trained at this scale.\n\n## Model Architecture\n\n- **INPUT**: Text tokens\n- **Token embeddings**\n- **Self-attention**\n- **Feedforward network**\n- **Self-attention**\n- **Feedforward network**\n- **OUTPUT**: Text token\n- **AUTOREGRESSIVE DECODING**\n\nTo address this, we made design choices that focus on keeping the model development process scalable and straightforward.\n\n- We opted for a standard decoder-only transformer model architecture with minor adaptations rather than a mixture-of-experts model to maximize training scalability.\n- We adopted an iterative post-training procedure, where each round uses supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. This enabled us to create the highest quality synthetic data for each round and improve each capability\u2019s performance.\n\nCompared to previous versions of Llama, we improved both the quantity and quality of the data we use for pre- and post-training. These improvements include the development of more careful pre-processing and curation pipelines for pre-training data, the development of more rigorous quality assurance, and filtering approaches for post-training data.\n\nAs expected per scaling laws for language models, our new flagship model outperforms smaller models trained using the same procedure. We also used the 405B parameter model to improve the post-training quality of our smaller models.\n\nTo support large-scale production inference for a model at the scale of the 405B, we quantized our models from 16-bit (BF16) to 8-bit (FP8) numerics, effectively lowering the compute requirements needed and allowing the model to run within a single server node.\n\n## Instruction and Chat Fine-tuning\n\nWith Llama 3.1 405B, we strove to improve the helpfulness, quality, and detailed instruction-following capability of the model in response to user instructions while", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}

Each round involves Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Rejection Sampling (RS), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We use synthetic data generation to produce the vast majority of our SFT examples, iterating multiple times to produce higher and higher quality synthetic data across all capabilities. Additionally, we invest in multiple data processing techniques to filter this synthetic data to the highest quality. This enables us to scale the amount of fine-tuning data across capabilities.\n\nWe carefully balance the data to produce a model with high quality across all capabilities. For example, we maintain the quality of our model on short-context benchmarks, even when extending to 128K context. Similarly, our model continues to provide maximally helpful answers, even as we add safety mitigations.\n\n## The Llama system\n\nLlama models were always intended to work as part of an overall system that can orchestrate several components, including calling external tools. Our vision is to go beyond the foundation models to give developers access to a broader system that gives them the flexibility to design and create custom offerings that align with their vision. This thinking started last year when we first introduced the incorporation of components outside of the core LLM.\n\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to develop AI responsibly beyond the model layer and helping others to do the same, we\u2019re releasing a full reference system that includes several sample applications and includes new components such as Llama Guard 3, a multilingual safety model and Prompt Guard, a prompt injection filter. These sample applications are open source and can be built on by the community.\n\nThe implementation of components in this Llama System vision is still fragmented. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve started working with industry, startups, and the broader community to help better define the interfaces of these components. To support this, we\u2019re releasing a request for comment on GitHub for what we\u2019re calling \u201cLlama Stack.\u201d Llama Stack is a set of standardized and opinionated interfaces for how to build canonical toolchain components (fine-tuning, synthetic data generation) and agentic applications. Our hope is for these to become adopted across the ecosystem, which should help with easier interoperability.\n\nWe welcome feedback and ways to improve the proposal.

That\u2019s why we continue to take steps on the path for open access AI to become the industry standard.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen the community build amazing things with past Llama models including an AI study buddy built with Llama and deployed in WhatsApp and Messenger, an LLM tailored to the medical field designed to help guide clinical decision-making, and a healthcare non-profit startup in Brazil that makes it easier for the healthcare system to organize and communicate patients\u2019 information about their hospitalization, all in a data secure way.

While it\u2019s an incredibly powerful model, we recognize that it requires significant compute resources and expertise to work with. We\u2019ve spoken with the community, and we realize there\u2019s so much more to generative AI development than just prompting models. We want to enable everyone to get the most out of the 405B, including:\n\n- Real-time and batch inference\n- Supervised fine-tuning\n- Evaluation of your model for your specific application\n- Continual pre-training\n- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- Function calling\n- Synthetic data generation\n\nThis is where the Llama ecosystem can help. On day one, developers can take advantage of all the advanced capabilities of the 405B model and start building immediately. Developers can also explore advanced workflows like easy-to-use synthetic data generation, follow turnkey directions for model distillation, and enable seamless RAG with solutions from partners, including AWS, NVIDIA, and Databricks.

There\u2019s so much potential for building helpful new experiences using the multilinguality and increased context length. With the Llama Stack and new safety tools, we look forward to continuing to build together with the open source community responsibly. Before releasing a model, we work to identify, evaluate, and mitigate potential risks through several measures, including pre-deployment risk discovery exercises through red teaming, and safety fine-tuning. For example, we conduct extensive red teaming with both external and internal experts to stress test the models and find unexpected ways they may be used. (Read more about how we\u2019re scaling our Llama 3.1 collection of models responsibly in this blog post.)\n\nWhile this is our biggest model yet, we believe there\u2019s still plenty of new ground to explore in the future, including more device-friendly sizes, additional modalities, and more investment at the agent platform layer. As always, we look forward to seeing all the amazing products and experiences the community will build with these models.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}
